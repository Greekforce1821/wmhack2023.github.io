All participants of the Wikimedia Hackathon 2023 are welcome to contribute to this blog.
Being Jekyll + Github Pages based, contributions can be submitted in the form of `Pull requests` to [https://github.com/wmhack2023/wmhack2023.github.io](https://github.com/wmhack2023/wmhack2023.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Contributions can be posts about sessions one has participated, general experience about participating in the Hackathon, account of achievements during the Hackathon, introduction of collaboration teams, etc.

On practical terms in order to propose a contribution prepare a Jekyll **`post`** and follow instructions:
+ [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui){:target="_blank"}
+ [https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github){:target="_blank"}  

or approach in person volunteers supporting this blog. Accepted contributions need to, at least, be in `.md` format and placed in the `_posts` repo folder; photos are only accepted if linked from Wikimedia Commons. If still in doubt regarding how to prepare a post, clone an existing one and adapt appropriately.

The volunteers supporting this blog will do their best to keep track of contributions and coordinate blogging effort.
